# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machinery: Leveraging Machine Learning to Minimize Downtime

## Problem Statement

This project has been done in fulfillment to the Capstone Project requirement of Entri Elevate's Data Science and Machine Learning Program.

In the field of industrial maintenance and operations, the timely detection of machine failures is crucial to prevent unexpected downtime, minimize production losses and optimize maintenance strategies. Machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for predicting and classifying data.

This project addresses the need for proactive maintenance strategies in industrial settings by developing a machine-learning model to predict equipment failures based on historical sensor data. By analyzing patterns in sensor readings, the model aims to forecast potential failures before they occur, enabling timely maintenance interventions. The goal is to minimize downtime, optimize resource allocation, and reduce maintenance costs by transitioning from reactive to proactive maintenance practices. Through this approach, manufacturing plants can improve operational efficiency, maximize equipment uptime, and enhance overall productivity.

## Objectives

* Development of a robust predictive maintenance model leveraging machine learning techniques.
* Reduction in unplanned downtime through proactive maintenance interventions.
* Cost savings, optimized resource allocation, and enhanced productivity in industrial machinery operations.
* Evaluate the performance of different models in predicting Machine failure.
* Evaluate the impact of different feature selection methods on the performance of predictive maintenance models.
